        question:'What are the financial benefits of solar energy?',
        answer:'When you install a solar energy system on your property, you save money on your electricity bills and protect yourself against rising electricity rates in the future. How much you can save depends on the utility rates and solar policies in your area, but going solar is a smart investment regardless of where you live.'

        question:'What is net metering?',
        answer:'With net metering, you only pay for the electricity that you use beyond what your solar panels can generate. This depends on the state the homeowner lives in.'

        panel:'3',
        question:'How does solar affect my property value?',
        answer:'Property value will only increase if you own, rather than lease, your solar panel system. In most parts of the country, going solar will actually increase your property value more than a kitchen renovation.'

        panel:'4',
        question:'How do solar photovoltaic (PV) panels work?',
        answer:'Solar panels absorb the sun\'s energy throughout the day and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. Most homes and businesses run on alternating current (AC) electricity, so the DC electricity is then passed through an inverter to convert it to usable AC electricity.'

        panel:'5',
        question:'Does solar work when the sun is not shining?',
        answer:'A home will still be able to privde energy if it is a little cloudy outside, or it is raining.  The only time energy is not produced is at night and the electricity you receive is from the grid.'
    },
    {
        id:5,
        panel:'6',
        question:'Can I go off grid with solar?',
        answer:'Technically you can, this requires most homeowners to receive a battery installed on top of the solar system. A battery stores the excess energy the panels produce and instead of sending that excess power to the grid, it is stored into a battery than can be used at night or when the panels stop working.'
